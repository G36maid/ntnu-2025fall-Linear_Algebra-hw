# NTU 2025 Fall Linear Algebra Homework and Notes

Welcome to the repository for **NTU 2025 Fall Linear Algebra**! This project is designed to organize course materials, lecture notes, homework assignments, and resources for the Linear Algebra course. The goal is to create structured, Markdown-based notes that are easy to navigate and integrate with GitHub for collaboration and version control.

## Course Overview
Linear Algebra is a foundational course covering vectors, matrices, linear transformations, eigenvalues, vector spaces, and applications in various fields like computer science, engineering, and data science. This repo will track homework solutions, key concepts from lectures, and supplementary resources.

- **Instructor**: [To be filled]
- **Schedule**: Fall 2025, NTU
- **Prerequisites**: Basic calculus and high school algebra
- **Textbook**: [e.g., "Linear Algebra and Its Applications" by Gilbert Strang – update as needed]

## Project Structure
The repository follows a simple, standardized structure to keep everything organized:

- **`course-materials/`**: Original lecture slides, PDFs, videos, or other provided resources from the course.
- **`notes/`**: Markdown notes organized by topic (e.g., `01-vectors-and-matrices.md`). Follow the naming convention `XX-topic-name.md` for sequencing.
- **`homework/`**: Homework assignments, solutions, and related files (e.g., problem sets in Markdown or PDFs).
- **`notes/resources/`**: Detailed external resources, links, or appendices (e.g., proofs, examples, or toolkits like MATLAB/NumPy snippets).
- **Root Files**:
  - `README.md`: This file – overview and navigation.
  - `AGENTS.md`: Guidelines for AI agents or contributors (e.g., Markdown standards, no traditional builds).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Explore notes in `notes/` for lecture summaries.
3. Check `homework/` for assignments.
4. Use Markdown for all notes to ensure GitHub-friendly rendering.

## Notes Index
Here are links to the current notes (will be updated as content is added):

- [Homework 1-1](notes/01-homework-1-1.md)
- [Homework 2](notes/02-homework-2.md)
- [Homework 3](notes/03-homework-3.md)

## Homework
- [Homework 1](homework/HW1/)
- [Homework 2](homework/HW2/)
- [Homework 3](homework/HW3/)

## Contributing
- Follow GitHub Flavored Markdown for all files.
- Ensure links are clickable and descriptive.
- For conversions (e.g., PDF slides to Markdown), document any issues.
- No code builds required – this is documentation-focused.
